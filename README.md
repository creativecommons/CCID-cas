## What's this?

This is a Creative Commons theme for our [RubyCAS][rubycas] server, which is
part of our CCID single-signon initiative.

Mostly we're using [Bootstrap][bootstrap], untouched.

Also includes some basic PHP files for handling registration and lost
passwords.

has not been a commit since 2015-12-09 and there are 20 open pull requests. The
information website refers to Jasig, but it has not existed since it merged
with the Sakai foundation in 2012 December to form the Apereo Foundation. The
IRC channel is empty.

[rbCAS/CASinoApp][casinoapp] was evaluated as a potential replacement in early
2017, but found to be more trouble than it was worth. Also, as of 2019 April,
the project appears to be abandoned. There has not been a commit since
2016-05-08.
